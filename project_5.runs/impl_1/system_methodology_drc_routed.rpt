LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell d1/c_out_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) a1/c_out_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell d1/mode_a_reg[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) d1/mode_a_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell d1/mode_a_reg[3]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) d1/mode_a_reg[1]/CLR, d1/mode_a_reg[2]/CLR, d1/mode_a_reg[3]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
